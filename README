This is a collection of PHP libraries that I like to use. They represent my learning curve in PHP and I don't recommend you use them (because you can do a LOT better). But I have stuff built on them so, unless I want to rewrite everything...

Why is this available to you? Because it would cost me $7 month to hide it, that's why. And it's not worth $7 a month to me to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot by using my crappy PHP libraries. So put the gun down and back away slowly.
